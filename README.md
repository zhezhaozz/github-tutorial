# Collaborative development using Git and GitHub

This is a tutorial about collaborative development using Git and GitHub I made for my lab and the Academia Cafe community. This repository was inspired and modified from the git tutorial created by [romankouz](https://github.com/romankouz/git_tutorial).

## Getting Started

1. Click Fork button on the upper-right corner to fork this repository. 
2. At your **terminal**, move to desired directory and type
```
